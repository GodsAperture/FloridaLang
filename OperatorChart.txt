This chart is used to keep track of operators and operator precedence.
Top most operators are of highest precedence.
Operators on the same line are always of equal precedence to each other.
Operators on the same line are always of the same associativity.
Binary operators take the form `returnType leftType OperatorName rightType (Associativity)`.
Binary operators that do not specify an associativity do not have associativity.
Associativity is exclusively LtR (left to right) or RtL (Right to Left).
Unary operators take the form `returnType leftType OperatorName NULL` or `returnType NULL OperatorName rightType`.
Instances where INumber1 or INumber2 appear means these can take any of the forms:
ufixed8, ufixed4, ufixed2, ufixed1, fixed8, fixed4, fixed2, fixed1, float8, float4.
Instances where INumberMax appears will be the value that is of higher importance.
For example, INumberMax ufixed1 + ufixed2 would be the same as ufixed2 ufixed1 + ufixed2.
These will be the operators in the standard library.

The () and [] operators will always be the highest precedence.

rightType leftType . rightType (LtR), rightType leftType -> rightType (LtR)
INumber1 INumber1 ! NULL
INumberMax INumber1 ^ INumber2 (RtL)
INumberMax INumber1 * INumber2 (LtR), INumberMax INumber1 / INumber2 (LtR)
INumberMax INumber1 + INumber2 (LtR), INumberMax INumber1 - INumber2 (LtR)
string INumber1 + string (LtR), string string + INumber1 (LtR)
boolean INumber1 > INumber2, boolean INumber1 < INumber2, boolean INumber1 <= INumber2, boolean INumber1 >= INumber2
boolean NULL ! boolean
boolean boolean XOR boolean (LtR)
boolean boolean AND boolean (LtR)
boolean boolean OR boolean (LtR)
right variable = right (RtL)
